Design for project:
Entities
fairly straightforward, classes with properties and objects as instructed (also add ToString methods in order to print out)

UseEntities
create objects of person and product
create an array of persons (which sounds much better than people)
to fill array: for loop which takes input from the input.txt file
to print array: for loop, print each index in the array

Two types of people: customers and employees (two types of employees: manager and Sales Rep)
Customers have credit cards
