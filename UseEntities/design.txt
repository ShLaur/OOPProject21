Design for project:
Entities
fairly straightforward, classes with properties and objects as instructed (also add ToString methods in order to print out)

UseEntities
create objects of person and product
create an array of persons (which sounds much better than people)
to fill array: for loop which takes input from the input.txt file
to print array: for loop, print each index in the array

Two types of people: customers and employees (two types of employees: manager and Sales Rep)
Customers have credit cards

DAL Layer:
ProductDAL class with methods for initializing list and CRUD methods

BLL layer:
Calls DAL layer and throws exception if necessary. DAL layer catches it.

UIL
some ideas for product GUI section:
	float and dock everything to take up full space called home page.
	then when you hit one, all of them move to top as a menu, with option to go back to home page
	view product: enter product number and then pull up info
	modify allows you to enter a product number and then modify everything else, but initial text is what it is, and then they can change it
