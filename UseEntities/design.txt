Design for project:
Entities
fairly straightforward, classes with properties and objects as instructed (also add ToString methods in order to print out)

UseEntities
create objects of person and product
create an array of persons (which sounds much better than people)
to fill array: for loop which takes input from the input.txt file
to print array: for loop, print each index in the array

Two types of people: customers and employees (two types of employees: manager and Sales Rep)
Customers have credit cards

DAL Layer:
ProductDAL, customerDAL class with methods for initializing list and CRUD methods

BLL layer:
Calls DAL layer

UIL
PRODUCT some ideas for product GUI section:
	float and dock everything to take up full space called home page.
	then when you hit one, all of them move to top as a menu, with option to go back to home page (we didn't end up doing this, but it can remain in the idea box)
	view product: enter product number and then pull up info with options to delete or modify
	modify allows you to enter a product number and then modify everything else, but initial text is what it is, and then they can change it
CUSTOMER idea board:
	fairly similar to the product one, but needs more complex details groupbox to allow for credit card info. but find dhould just show last four digits of creidt card
	modify should have add.modify/delete credit card option as a sub option, and should be password protected or somethimg




Shira 
	credit card: have a text box dash text box dash ect. append the input together to make string of number together to check credit card number
	only show last 4 digit to user unless input password
