Product Sales Project for Programming 2(Real Version)
This is a project my partner cwachss and I worked on.

It is a three tier archetecture project for our fictional toy company.

Using GUI, BLL, DAL, and a text document in place of a database, this mosern-styled sales app can record sales, list products, and add new clients.
