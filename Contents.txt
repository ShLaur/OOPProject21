The entities program contains person and product objects
The UseEntities Program uses above objects

Design for project:
Entities
fairly straightforward, classes with properties and objects as instructed (also add ToString methods in order to print out)

UseEntities
create objects of person and product
create an array of persons (which sounds much better than people)
to fill array: for loop in which user enters names and id numbers which are used in the creation of person objects stored in the array until the array is full 
to print array: for loop, print each index in the array
